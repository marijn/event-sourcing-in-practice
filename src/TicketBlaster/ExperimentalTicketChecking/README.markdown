TicketBlaster
=============

You just joined TicketBlaster: a company that operates a ticket selling platform in the European market. 
The customers of TicketBlaster are event organizers that want to sell tickets online using the TicketBlaster platform.

Most of the customers organize small scale events with less than 1.000 tickets sold. Everything the company offers is completely self-service.

Ticket buyers purchase tickets through the online TicketBlaster channels.
Once they have paid for their tickets they will receive their tickets through email or the mobile app.
Each ticket is uniquely identifiable by its ticket code.

When the time has come to attend the event, ticket holders will present their ticket to a host at one of the entrances of the venue. 
The ticket will be checked and if the ticket is valid the ticket holder will be granted access to the event.

The system that the company uses for ticket checking is commercial off the shelf software. Unfortunately it hasn’t been as reliable in the past year as it used to be. 
On top of that the success of the company has also turned it into a prey for scammers. More and more fraud with tickets is happening which has been causing damage to the brands' reputation.

The company wants to explore alternatives. 
The goal is to find out if designing a proprietary ticket checking system provides any opportunities. 
Marketeers in the company see potential in marketing “Fraud Radar” as a differentiating feature as well as “Automatic After Sales”.

Fraud Radar would provide insights into failed attempts to enter the venue with invalid tickets.

Automatic After Sales would allow the organizer to differentiate after sales messages like emails to be personalized based on attendance.

Your team has been charged with designing multiple prototypes for a ticket checking system. Have fun and good luck!
